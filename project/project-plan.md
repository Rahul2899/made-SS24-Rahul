# Project Plan

## Climate Change: Factors Affecting Temperature and Rainfall in Crop Production.
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->


## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
How does climate change, particularly changes in temperature, affect rainfall patterns and crop yields? 
## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
This project investigates how rising temperatures caused by climate change impact rainfall patterns and crop yields. It analyzes the complex relationship between temperature, precipitation, and crop growth to develop sustainable agricultural practices and adaptation strategies for a changing climate.
## Datasources

<!-- Describe each datasources you plan to use in a section. Use the prefic "DatasourceX" where X is the id of the datasource. -->
